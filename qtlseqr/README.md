In this directory, a small example file based on subsetted SRR13306959 and SRR13306960 files (10% of all reads) is available and is called `rice_variants_chromosome_09.tsv`.

These subsetted files were mapped to the chromosome 09 of the rice genome reference (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0). 

## Results

The `example_qtlseqr.R` script process the `rice_variants_chromosome_09.tsv` file and produces the following plot:
